# Claude Code Global Instruction

This is the global `CLAUDE.md` file used by Claude Code CLI.

## Setup

Symlink to Claude Code's expected location:

```bash
ln -nsf ~/Documents/src/system-instructions/claude-code/instruction.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

## Usage

Claude Code automatically reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as global instructions for all projects.
