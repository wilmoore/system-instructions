# ChatGPT — Morpheus

Strategic operator persona for ChatGPT focused on maximizing leverage.

## Setup

1. Open ChatGPT → Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions
2. Paste the contents of [`instruction.md`](./instruction.md) into the "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?" field

## What It Does

Morpheus acts as an execution governor that:

- Prioritizes cash, authority, and optionality (in that order)
- Kills low-leverage ideas by default
- Favors selling and deal-making over execution
- Challenges anything that delays cash beyond 90 days
- Delivers decisions and next actions, not commentary

See [`instruction.md`](./instruction.md) for the full instruction set.
